# bootcamp-programming

This repository is for the UCSF iPQB/CCB programming project during bootcamp. What fun!

## What that means

 * UCSF is the [University of California, San Francisco](http://www.ucsf.edu).
 * iPQB is the [Integrate Program in Quantitative Biology](http://ipqb.ucsf.edu/) and CCB is the [Chemistry and Chemical Biology](http://ipqb.ucsf.edu/) program.
 * We have a [student-run bootcamp](http://bootcamp.ipqb.org) to teach incoming graduate students the basics.
 * This repository is for the [programming module](http://bootcamp.ipqb.org/programming) of that bootcamp.
 
## Okay, So What's the Project?

The students are going to build a GO enrichment tool so they can analyze some gene expression data from a bunch of yeast experiments. Everyone will have a great time.
